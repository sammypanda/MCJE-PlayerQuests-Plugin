# 📖 Welcome to PlayerQuests Guide!
Hey! Thanks for being here. Let's create some quests in survival 💖🗺️

<br>

### 📍 Getting Started
If you're new and want to know how to make a quest, see [this tutorial](tutorial/README.md).

<br>

### ❔ What quests can do
I'm always planning to add more quest actions, but so far:

| Action                                  | Description                                            | Supported |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Speak                                   | Makes an NPC say something                             | ✅        |
| None                                    | Ends the quest (default)                               | ✅        |

### ❔ Types of NPCs
NPCs are the main part of how quests are interacted with.

| NPC Type                                              | Supported |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Block                                                 | ✅        |
| Customised Blocks                                     | ❌        |
