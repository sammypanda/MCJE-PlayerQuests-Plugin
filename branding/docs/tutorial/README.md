2. Send your quest title in the chat (or send **'exit'** to leave). I'll call mine **'Test'**. When you're happy send **'confirm'**
3. You'll see a new screen that might seem a bit overwhelming... but don't worry! Just press **Save** to create your quest. It won't have any NPCs, stages or actions yet, but that's okay! üòä
