<h1 id="guide">How to use the plugin ⚛</h1>

- You can find the pre-release guide [here](https://github.com/sammypanda/MCJE-PlayerQuests-Plugin/tree/main/branding#readme). 
    - Things are subject to change, but I'm happy to answer questions on Discord.

<br>

<h1 id="add">To add to your server, follow these steps ✿</h1>

- Download the latest .jar file.
- Drag and drop the .jar file into the server 'plugins' folder.
  - Note: Create the plugins folder if it doesn't exist.

<br>

<h1 id="guide">Disabling telemetry ⚛</h1>

- This plugin uses [bStats](https://github.com/Bastian/bStats) to share how many servers are using the plugin.
- To disable bStats:
    1. Create a folder in plugins/ called ``bStats`` (case sensitive)
    2. In it create a file called config.yml
        - Type in it ``enabled: false``
- To enable, delete the bStats folder and reload/restart, it'll default to ``enabled: true``.

<br>

<h1 id="configure">No configuration options ✎</h1>

- Keeping it simple.

<br>
